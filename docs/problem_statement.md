#Project Name

Beyond the Chatbot – AI-Powered Intelligent Tutoring System

#Problem Statement

Traditional online learning platforms (like Coursera, YouTube tutorials, and MOOCs) are generic and non-structured, often leaving students without a clear progressive learning path.
They lack:
.Personalized interaction and adaptive feedback.
.Step-by-step logic-building exercises.
.Multilingual/bilingual support for rural and non-English background students.
.A bridge between learning → practice → career readiness.
As a result, students (especially in rural areas and under-resourced colleges) struggle to:
.Develop strong problem-solving and coding logic.
.Receive guidance in their own language.
.Connect their skills to real-world applications, hackathons, and job opportunities.

#Our Goals
1. Logic Building from the Ground Up
.Provide step-by-step coding exercises that visualize the thinking process.
.Adaptive difficulty: system adjusts based on student performance.
.AI-generated quizzes and hints for mastery.
2. Sandbox for Learning & Practice
.Interactive coding environment to try, debug, and learn without external setup.
3. Bilingual & Inclusive Learning
.Content, quizzes, and hints in both English + regional languages.
.AI-powered real-time translation for collaborative pair programming.
